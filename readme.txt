Dynamic Form in Javascript

This program reads in a selection of options from an XML file.  Once the selections are read in, they are put into a list.  From that list, the program generates the select statements, with the appropriate options and attributes.  When the user makes a final selection, a picture is displayed with a relevant color scheme (taken from Adobe Kuler) and a text node with the final options.  There is a form that displays that will allow the user to email themselves the color choice, as well as a button that allows the user to “download” a bigger version of the picture being displayed.

The site redirects the user to the Chrome homepage if it detects that the user is using Internet Explorer.  Internet Explorer did not seem to display this site properly in all regards, therefore I don’t support it.  It works fine in Firefox/Chrome/Safari.

A live version is hosted at http://kelvin.ist.rit.edu/~axs2931/340/project1/

NOTE: Form won’t actually do untying, as it is not hooked up to a server.
